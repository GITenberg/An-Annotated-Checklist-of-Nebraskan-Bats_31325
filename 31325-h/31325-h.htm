<h3>HISTORY</h3>

<p>The first mention of bats in Nebraska possibly was by Harrison
Allen, in his "Monograph of the Bats of North America" (1864:14,
20, 30, 35, 42), who listed <i>Nycticejus crepuscularis</i> [= <i>Nycticeius
humeralis</i>], <i>Lasiurus borealis</i>, <i>Scotophilus carolinensis</i> and <i>Scotophilus
fuscus</i> [both = <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>], and <i>Scotophilus noctivagans</i>
[= <i>Lasionycteris noctivagans</i>], as collected in "Nebraska"
(then Nebraska Territory) by J. G. Cooper. Henry W. Setzer (in
<i>litt.</i>) reports that none of the bats collected by Cooper now exists
in the United States National Museum and that no data pertaining
to any of them are available except that a single specimen of <i>Nycticeius
humeralis</i> was traded to the British Museum in 1866. Cooper
journeyed through parts of the present state of Nebraska in the
summer and autumn of 1857 and, judging from Taylor's (1919:72-80)
report of Cooper's travels, this was the only time he entered
any part of Nebraska Territory. The writers are of the opinion
that the specimens in question probably were collected in Nebraska;
but since Allen listed no exact localities or dates of collection and
since the specimens and data pertaining to them are not now available,
we have not included them here as Nebraskan records.</p>

<p>In the first comprehensive account of Nebraskan mammals, Myron
H. Swenk (1908:137-139) listed six kinds of bats, <i>Myotis evotis</i>,
<i>Myotis californicus ciliolabrum</i> [= <i>Myotis subulatus subulatus</i>],
<i>Lasionycteris noctivagans</i>, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, <i>Lasiurus borealis</i>, and
<i>Lasiurus cinereus</i>, as occurring within the state. Zimmer (1913:665)
recorded <i>Nyctinomus mexicanus</i> [= <i>Tadarida mexicana</i>] from
Nebraska. Subsequently, Swenk (1915:854) reported <i>Myotis lucifugus
lucifugus</i> in the state and three years later (1918:411) he
reported <i>Eptesicus fuscus pallidus</i> for the first time. The report of
<i>M. l. lucifugus</i> seemingly was not substantiated by any actual specimens.
The addition of <i>Myotis volans interior</i> (Quay, 1948:181)
brought to ten the number of species and subspecies of bats reported
from the state.</p>

<p>In the present paper, <i>Myotis keenii septentrionalis</i>, <i>Myotis lucifugus
carissima</i>, and <i>Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus</i> are reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
from Nebraska for the first time. Also, the first authentic record of
<i>Myotis lucifugus lucifugus</i> is presented, along with additional information
on previously reported species. A total number of 169
specimens from Nebraska was available for the present study. This
includes almost all of the known specimens preserved in all collections
as well as material obtained by us in the past six years.</p>

<p>Nebraska has no natural caves or caverns; however, there are two
extensive man-made limestone caves near Louisville, in Cass and
Sarpy counties, where four kinds of bats have been found. Two of
these are here reported as new to Nebraska. The quarries, one on
either side of the Platte River Valley, are in a horizontal stratum of
limestone 40 feet in thickness, and are of the room and pillar type;
that is to say, the stone has been quarried away leaving rooms having
supporting pillars approximately every 50 feet. The average
temperatures in summer and winter within these tunnels, recorded
over a period of several years by the Ash Grove Lime and Portland
Cement Company of Louisville, are 65&deg; F. and 50&deg; F. respectively.
The Kiewit Stone Quarry, abandoned since 1936, is one-half mile
west of Meadow, Sarpy County, and has one remaining entrance
measuring approximately 30 by 30 feet. This quarry has an area
of approximately one-fifth square mile and is usually flooded with
several feet of water. The other man-made cave, known formerly
as the National Stone Quarry, is one mile northeast of Louisville,
Cass County. This quarry was abandoned in September, 1938, and
until the winter of 1948-1949 had eight or nine entrances and two
air shafts. It was approximately one-third square mile in area. All
the openings to this quarry were covered in late 1949. Bats were
first observed in the National Stone Quarry by one of us (Webb)
as early as 1939, less than a year after operations in the quarry
ceased.</p>


<h3>METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Records of Nebraskan bats are arranged in two categories; specimens examined
and additional records. The latter refer to citations in the literature.
Genera are arranged according to Simpson (1945:59, 60), and species are
listed alphabetically under each genus. Specimens examined are in the personal
collection of the authors unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>In connection with this study the authors acknowledge the assistance of
Drs. Edson H. Fichter, Department of Biological Sciences, Idaho State College,
and E. Raymond Hall and Rollin H. Baker, University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History for critical assistance with the manuscript. We are indebted
to Mr. Richard B. Loomis, University of Kansas, for aid in collecting specimens;
to Dr. Henry W. Setzer, United States National Museum, for providing information
on possible early Nebraskan records; and to Mr. Fred Brammer, Ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>

May 25, 1928.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from limestone quarries in Cass and
Sarpy counties. Probably in other parts of extreme eastern Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 35, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cass Co.</span>:
1 mi. NE Louisville, 4. <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W Meadow, 31 (some of these
specimens have been deposited in other collections as follows: Private Collection
of P. H. Krutzsch, 3; Private Collection of W. G. Frum, 2; Nebr. Game,
Forestation and Parks Comm., 1; Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 2; Univ. Nebr.
State Mus., 7).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Although not so common as <i>Pipistrellus</i> in the limestone
quarries, hibernating bats of this species frequently are found
there, usually as solitary individuals either in drill holes or clinging
to the walls of the quarries; occasionally, however, two or three bats
have been found together in a single drill hole.</p>


<h4>Myotis lucifugus carissima <span style="font-weight: normal">Thomas<br /><br />

Brown Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Myotis (Leuconoe) carissima</i> Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., (ser. 7),
13:383, May, 1904, type from Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming.</p>

<p><i>Myotis lucifugus carissima</i>, Cary, N. Amer. Fauna, 42:43, October 3, 1917.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from a single record in extreme northwestern
Nebraska, but probably occurs throughout Panhandle of state.</p>

<p><i>Record of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimen examined, 1, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>:
Agate, 1 (Univ. Mich. Mus. Zool.).</p></div>


<h4>Myotis lucifugus lucifugus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Le Conte)<br /><br />

Brown Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>V[espertilio]. lucifugus</i> Le Conte, McMurtrie's Cuvier, Animal Kingdom,
1:431, June, 1831, type from Georgia, probably from the Le Conte Plantation,
near Riceboro, Liberty County.</p>

<p><i>Myotis lucifugus [lucifugus]</i>, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:59, October 16,
1897.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known only from the limestone quarry in Sarpy
County, but probably occurs over most of eastern third of state.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 2, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>:
1/2 mi. W Meadow, 2 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 1).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Two bats of this subspecies were found in the quarry
in Sarpy County on December 30, 1949. None was found on subsequent
visits to the quarry, although three other species of bats
have been found there in large numbers. These specimens appear
to be the first actual records of <i>M. l. lucifugus</i> in the state, although
Swenk (1915:854, and in subsequent lists) reported it as "uncommon
eastwardly".</p>

<p>One of these bats, a male (KU 35076), possesses a peculiar dental
abnormality. Both of the second upper premolars (P3) are lacking,
although the mandibular dentition is normal. This condition has
been reported previously for this species by Frum (1946:176) in
specimens from West Virginia.</p>


<h4>Myotis subulatus subulatus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Say)<br /><br />

Small-footed Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Vespertilio subulatus</i> Say, Long's Exped. to Rocky Mts., 2:65 (footnote),
1823, type from the Arkansas River near La Junta, Otero Co., Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Myotis subulatus</i>, Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, G. P. Putnam's Sons,
New York, 1910. p. 275.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Northern and western Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 9, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cherry Co.</span>:
Valentine, 1 (Univ. Nebr. Dept. Zool.). <span class="smcap">Sheridan Co.</span>: Rushville, 1; 15 mi.
N Rushville, 2. <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>: Agate, 1 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.); Monroe
Canyon, 5-1/2 mi. N, 2-1/2 mi. W Harrison, 2 (Nebr. Game, Forestation and Parks
Comm.); Warbonnet Canyon, 2 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).</p>

<p>Additional records: <span class="smcap">Dakota Co.</span>: Crystal Lake, 1 (Stephens, 1945:92).
<span class="smcap">Dawes Co.</span>: Chadron, 1 (Miller and Allen, 1928:169). <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>: Antelope
Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181); Sugarloaf Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This bat is common along the Niobrara River in the
northwestern part of the state. Stephens (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reports taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a bat of this species in Dakota County in the northeastern corner of
Nebraska. This specimen was sent to Swenk at the University of
Nebraska for positive identification and was, according to Stephens,
deposited in the Swenk collection. No trace of the specimen can
be found at the present time. It is here assigned to <i>M. s. subulatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>M. s. subulatus</i> has been observed frequently in the Pine Ridge
area, generally in association with <i>Eptesicus fuscus pallidus</i>. Two
specimens were shot by us from many that were seen flying over
a small clearing in the pines in northern Sioux County on August 2,
1949. Several <i>Eptesicus</i> were also obtained there. One of us
(Webb) took two of these bats from their daytime retreat in a barn
north of Rushville, Sheridan County, on September 5, 1951, where
<i>Eptesicus</i> was also found. They are known to inhabit hay barns at
the Ft. Niobrara Game Reserve, Cherry County, also in association
with <i>Eptesicus</i>. Swenk (1908:137) reports finding two of these bats
under a loose strip of pine bark in Sioux County.</p>


<h4>Myotis volans interior <span style="font-weight: normal">Miller<br /><br />

Hairy-winged Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Badlands area of extreme northwestern part of
state.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 2, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>:
Warbonnet Township, 8 mi. N Harrison, 2 (Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist.).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Quay (1948:181) reported finding a colony of approximately
180 of these bats in northern Sioux County in the summer
of 1944. They were found in a crevice in a dry creek bed. He examined
several dozen, all females, two of which were saved as
specimens.</p>

<p>The authors, while engaged in field work in this approximate
locality in the summers of 1948 and 1949, were unable to locate any
of these bats.</p>


<h4>Lasionycteris noctivagans <span style="font-weight: normal">(Le Conte)<br /><br />

Silver-haired Bat</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;"Entire state, fairly common during migrations
but probably not breeding within our limits" (Swenk, 1908:138).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 2, as follows: <span class="smcap">Clay Co.</span>:

<h4>Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus <span style="font-weight: normal">(F. Cuvier)<br /><br />

Eastern Pipistrelle</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>V[espertilio]. subflavus</i> F. Cuvier, Nouv. Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, 1:17,
1832, type from eastern United States, probably Georgia.</p>

<p><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i>, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:90, October 16, 1897.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from limestone quarries in Cass and
Sarpy counties; probably ranging throughout eastern Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 34, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cass Co.</span>:
1 mi. NE Louisville, 4. <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W Meadow, 30 (some of these
specimens have been deposited in other collections as follows: Private Collection
of P. H. Krutzsch, 3; Private Collection of W. G. Frum, 2; Univ. Kansas
Mus. Nat. Hist., 4; Univ. Nebr. State Mus., 4).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This bat is the most common of the four species that
are known to inhabit the quarries in Cass and Sarpy counties. Individuals
have been found both in drill holes and clinging to the
walls of the quarries. We have always found this bat to be solitary
while in hibernation.</p>


<h4>Eptesicus fuscus fuscus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Beauvois)<br /><br />

Big Brown Bat</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Vespertilio fuscus</i> Beauvois, Catal. Raisonn&eacute; Mus. Peale, Philadelphia, p. 18,
1796, type from Philadelphia, Philadelphia Co., Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, M&eacute;hely, Magyarorsz&aacute;g denev&eacute;reinek monographi&aacute;ja (Monographia
Chiropterorum Hungariae), pp. 206, 338, 1900.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Eastern part of state.</p>

Louisville, 6; Plattsmouth, 1 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.). <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W
Meadow, 15 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus., 7).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;We have observed this bat hibernating in the limestone
quarries of Cass and Sarpy counties, where it was commonly
found in drill holes or clinging to the ceiling or walls. We have always
found this bat to be solitary while in hibernation, with one
exception. On January 31, 1949, a male and female were found in
the same drill hole in the Cass County quarry. The jolt of being
knocked from the hole separated the two bats, and upon examination
the penis of the male was noted to be extended and erected, indicating
that the pair might have been in the act of copulation.</p>

in the unused portion of a barn loft at Ft. Niobrara Game
Reserve on August 11, 1948. Although no temperature readings
were taken, it was estimated that the temperature was more than
100&deg; F. in the loft. The bats were congregated on rafters at the
north end of the barn and when disturbed, only a few members of
the colony dropped from the rafters to fly. Most of the bats crawled
to new retreats between the rafters and the corrugated iron roof of
the building.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
